                <h2>Sec-A</h2>
                <p>A full-stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.

                    In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
                    Program a browser (e.g. using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue) ,
                    Program a server (e.g. using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node) ,
                    Program a database (e.g. using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)</p>

                <p>  <h2>Sec-B</h2>
                    Software development is a fast-paced, exciting field that reflects the centrality of software in today's world. From smartphones to organizational productivity to AI applications, the famous 2011 claim made by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen still rings true: “Software is eating the world.”

                <p>  <h2>Sec-C</h2>
                    Full stack development encompasses the complete process of application software development, including both the front-end and back-end development. The front end consists of the user interface (or UI), and the back end handles the business logic and application workflows that run behind the scenes.

                <p> <h2>Sec-D</h2>
                    As the front end takes shape, the full stack developer is simultaneously building and integrating the back end. They select a server-side language like Node.js, Python, or Ruby and set up the necessary development environment. They design the database schema, choosing a suitable database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

                    When issues or bugs arise in a web application, a full stack developer can be invaluable. Their knowledge of the complete system allows them to quickly identify the root cause of the problem
